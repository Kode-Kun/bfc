# Simple brainfuck compiler

`bfc` is a simple brainfuck compiler, created as an experiment in interpreter and compiler design.

`bfc` is currently only an interpreter, but it has the building blocks (it parses the entire source and creates an Abstract Syntax Tree before interpreting it) to make a compiler.

`bfc` is written as a single file of pure C, and depends only on libc.
